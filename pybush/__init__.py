This package contains useful classes designed to organize your Application.

It allows you to interact with various protocols from/to your app.
For now, only OSC is implemented, but the goal is to support at least :
- OSC
- Minuit
- PJ-Link
- MIDI
- DMX / ARTNET
- Serial

A few apps that might use pybush :
- Configurable Bridge between protocols
- Inter-media sequencer
- IOT embedded app
- Show controler

Don't beat about the bush, it is lib for writing inter/multi-media scenario.

As a bush, pybush model is a tree graph, with one and only one trunk.
A Trunk might conatain branches and leaves.

Trunk Class
This is the first thing to create. The trunk is an entry point to access
branches and leaves.

from pybush import new_trunk
my_app = new_trunk('My App')

Leave Class
Now that we have a trunk, you can create some leaves.

pos_x = my_app.new_parameter('pos/x')

Two instances of Branch Class are created :
- 'pos'
    - 'x'
pos_x.parent is 'x' instance
pos_x.parent.parent is 'pos' instance
pos_x.get_device() is my_app
my_app.children = ['pos']
'pos'.children = ['x']
'x'.state = [pos_x]

A leave is a Branch with a leaf attribut set to a Leaf Instance

You cam call make_state() method for each Branch
that makes leaves comming back to a certain state 

Name must be unique in the namespace.
When you create a name, it will raise an error if there is already
the same name.

Nodes are used to organize your namespace.
Leaves are used for parameters and controlers.
- Parameter : It is a string, integer, boolean, float or list with a state.
- Controler : It is the result of a computation (algorythm/remote/controler)

There is others optionnals properties for each branch / state / trunk:
- tags : tags are un unordered list of strings.
- description : description for the object
