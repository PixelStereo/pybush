"""
This package contains useful classes designed to organize your Application
It allows you to interact with various protocols from/to your app
It works as a project manager for writing inter/multi-media scenario.

As a bush, pybush model is a tree graph, with branches and leaves.

Here everything is based on a Node concept
We have an abstract base Class : NodeAbstract

The 'root' Node is a class called Device.
This is the first thing to create.
The device is an entry to acces its children or its sibling (both parameters)
through different protocols. In your application, you can create any nodes
or directly any parameters you want.

In each Node, you can create another nodes.
Each Node can contain a value. If it does, it is a Parameter.
It is just a Node with a value (and attributes relative to the value)
When you create a parameter, it automatically creates a node, as it is bassed
on the Node Class.
So you can even create another node or another parameter under a node

Node base class has at least 1 property which is a name.

Name must be unique in the namespace.
When you create a name, it will raise an error if there is already
the same name.
Nodes are used to organize your namespace.
Leaves are used for parameters and controlers.
- Parameter : It is a string, integer, boolean, float or list with a state.
- Controler : It is the result of a computation (algorythm/remote/controler)

There is others optionnals properties for each nodes, which are :
- tags : tags are un unordered list of strings.
