This package contains useful classes designed to organize your Application
It allows you to interact with various protocols from/to your app
It works as a project manager for writing inter/multi-media scenario.

As a bush, pybush model is a tree graph, with branches and leaves.

Here everything is based on the Node base Class.

The 'root' Node is a class called Application.
The application is an entry to acces its children or its sibling through different protocols
In your application, you can create any nodes or directly any parameters you want.

In each Node, you can create nodes and leaves.
When you create a leaf, it automatically creates a nodes, as it is bassed on the Node Class.
So you can even create another node or another leaf under a node (or a leaf, because a leaf is a node).

Node base class has at least 1 property which is a name.
    - a name

Name must be unique in the namespace.
When you create a name, it will raise an error if there is already the same name.

There is others optionnals properties for each nodes, which are
    - a priority
    	- priority is a positiv integer which will allow to classify nodes.
    	  if there is several nodes with the same priority, they will be ordered alphabetically.
    - some tags
    	- tags are un unordered list of strings.

Nodes are used to organize your namespace.
Leaves are used for parameters, messages and returns.
	- Parameter:
		- a parameter is a string, integer, boolean, float or list with a state.
	- Message:
		- a message is as a parameter but without a state.
	- Return:
		- a return is a result of a computation made by an algorythm or a controller.
